 <h3>Interstellar</h3>

 <p>Definitely in my top 2 adult movies. Its about a man who lets go of his world to protect it. Must watch (literally cried) especially if you want the heart to move :)</p>

 <h3>Seven</h3>
 Couldn't find it :(
 <p>Extremely well made movie, its super popular and a huge meme came out of it. Its about 2 detectives and their search for a serial killer. It's so psychological, so much depth absolutely loved it. Definitely recommend!!</p>
 
 <h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>

 <p>holy guac a moly, so good and heartfelt, just feels like your experiencing their jailed lives with them. </p>
 
 <h3>The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar</h3>
 <a href = "https://www.netflix.com/us/title/81388090?s=i&trkid=258593161&vlang=en">Here</a>
 <p>Very weird execution of a movie, feels more like a book. super unique and one of a kind. It's also a short film so if you want something quick its convenient.</p>
 
 <h3>How to Train your Dragon</h3>
 <a href = "https://ww4.123moviesfree.net/movie/how-to-train-your-dragon-1750/">Here</a>
 <p>My Favorite movie of all time adult and child, maybe its the nostalgia effect but it holds a comfy spot in my heart.</p>
 
 <h3>Harry potter (The Entire series)</h3>
 <a href = "https://ww4.123moviesfree.net/movie/harry-potter-and-the-sorcerers-stone-1552/">Here</a>
 <p>Honestly crazy enough for me to even recommend, you should've watched this when you were younger. Magical world crazy good definitely needs to be watched once completely in your life time. personally as individual movies they're up there but as a whole series of movies its #1.</p>

 <h3>The Hunger Games</h3>
 <a href = "https://www.netflix.com/ca/title/70206672">Here</a>
 <p>Crazy good! if i had to descirbe the movie in one word, its classism. theres a shit ton of parallels with reality, i think you'd love this honestly. Fun fact i've heard of a lot people seeing the parallel with gaza.</p>

 <h3>Inception</h3>
<a href = "https://ww4.fmovies.co/film/inception-2756/">Here</a>
<p>Such a good concept for a movie, its about dreams, its sooooooo good, fuck! 10/10 movie.</p>
